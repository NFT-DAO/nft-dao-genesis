@newmindflow

 Initial Auction Plan Ideas so far: ![:black\_small\_square:](https://discordapp.com/assets/60c5854fe77ca7a4946b7c801c559f4a.svg) 

limited to artists who have committed/contributed to the DAO ![:black\_small\_square:](https://discordapp.com/assets/60c5854fe77ca7a4946b7c801c559f4a.svg) create a source of revenue for the DAO through a revenue split ![:black\_small\_square:](https://discordapp.com/assets/60c5854fe77ca7a4946b7c801c559f4a.svg) possible revenue split 60% - artist; 40% -DAO, or possibly a flexible rate between 20-40% going towards the DAO, chosen by the artist \(these are NOT fees - should seem reasonable to artists wo want to contribute to the growth of the DAO and want to invest in it\) ![:black\_small\_square:](https://discordapp.com/assets/60c5854fe77ca7a4946b7c801c559f4a.svg) at the end of the auction, the percentage directed to the DAO from the total sale value will be taken into account and added to the total artists contribution, when calculating the distribution of governance tokens. ![:black\_small\_square:](https://discordapp.com/assets/60c5854fe77ca7a4946b7c801c559f4a.svg) two main collections, one of Cardano related works and one composed of general works from each author ![:black\_small\_square:](https://discordapp.com/assets/60c5854fe77ca7a4946b7c801c559f4a.svg) percentage on future sales 10% to the artists, 5% to the DAO ![:black\_small\_square:](https://discordapp.com/assets/60c5854fe77ca7a4946b7c801c559f4a.svg) the DAO should approve or not the participation of an artist in the initial auction based on contributions/values reflected in art, but it shouldn’t be the DAO’s business to select each piece individually in the personal collection of an artist.
