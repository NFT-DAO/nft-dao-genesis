## Art Marketplace Name Survey results

@tyler.wales

Name ideas receiving 30% or more yes votes are:

| **Name** | **Percentage** |
| :--- | :--- |
| AdaMint | 50% |
| Cadence | 45.5% |
| Emergence | 40.9% |
| Genesis | 40.9% |
| StudioDAO | 40.9% |
| Spark | 36.4% |
| Magna | 36.4% |
| Akkadia | 31.8% |
| Arthaus | 31.8% |

#### Notes:

MagnaMint and AdaMint did not receive as many votes as the others as they were late additions to the survey based on Dan’s canvas that he shared in this channel.

#### Please consider:

Even though some of these names did well in the community vote, there can be reasons that deem them unusable. For example, “Spark” seems like a solid name, but when you do a google search you will find that it has already been used to name multiple software companies and the Chevy SPARK
