###  Governance DAO Roadmap Notes

**2021-2022** - Plan to link Catalyst \(primarily concerned at present with Treasury\) with Voltaire \(primarily concerned at present with protocol updates\).

Some of this unification will happen in 2021 to complete in 2022.

Entire HFC \(Hard Fork Combinator\) system \(HFC Alonzo\) will be further formalized and put under the control of Voltaire with \(probably\) a bicameral voting model.

Ancillary functionality to build such as  : liquid feedback, expert ballots, getting the economics right.

Catalyst is one of Cardano's most successful products because all the KPIs \(Key Performance Indicators\) are being hit in Fund after Fund.

### DAO-Voting as a service

Would like development of Dapps, De-Fi etc. on Cardano to be provided with DAO-Voting as a service.

Monetary policies, update system for code etc. would come with token issuance connected to unified Catalyst /Voltaire system which would handle DAO-Voting for you.

We are going to overbuild the Governance stuff in Catalyst /Voltaire as we move forward.

That means we will add other voting systems such as preference-voting, quadratic-voting 

Even if we don't use these voting systems for Cardano it provides a library for your Dapps if you have different Governance preferences.

**2025**

Also going to launch a research agenda to move from a Plutocratic model \(ADA's current status\) to a Hybrid model \(ADA plus Proof of Merit\). Proof of Merit is a very ill-defined concept - consequentially deliverable is closer to 2025 than 2021.

We need to bootstrap the social dynamics of the system to exhibit Proof of Merit then people over time will build identity and reputation on that and hold a different notion of power.

Lot of Political Science, Systems Design, Mechanism Design ; foundational research that has to be done with the Cardano community.

Speculates that : innovation will appear first at the Dapp layer \(as a service using the Catayst framework\) then at some point through the HFC  \(Hard Fork Combinator\) process and the consent of the governed will emerge \(merge ?\) to a more nuanced power dynamic for the entire system.
