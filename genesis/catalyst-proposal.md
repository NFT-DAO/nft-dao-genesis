##  **Problem statement**

42 Catalyst proposals address NFT point solutions—yet **we lack an overarching DApp strategy** to dominate as the de facto NFT platform choice.

##  **Describe your solution to the problem**

Coordinate an **NFT DAO that implements all NFT DApp requirements** to build a penultimate composable NFT Framework—**a WAX Killer on Cardano.**

##  **Relevant experience**

The 42 **proposing teams cover the range of skills and experience needed** to build the best possible solution to dominate the NFT space.
