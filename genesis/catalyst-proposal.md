###  **Describe your solution to the problem**

Coordinate an **NFT DAO that implements all NFT DApp requirements** to build a penultimate composable NFT Framework—**a WAX Killer on Cardano.**

###  **Relevant experience**

The 42 **proposing teams cover the range of skills and experience needed** to build the best possible solution to dominate the NFT space.

##  **A Modular Framework for NFTs on Cardano**

### Vision Statement

NFT-DAO envisions an open-source composable NFT framework for all—instead of multiple point solutions only benefiting some.

NFT DAO envisions a comprehensive NFT strategy and open-source framework that enables all users \(technical and non-technical\) to easily deploy industry specific tokenized asset marketplaces.

We seek an organized community effort to fully define comprehensive requirements for the penultimate NFT platform of any blockchain and build it as a Cardano asset anyone can use to build their specialized marketplaces or NFT solutions upon. We can build better together.

### Problem

42 Catalyst proposals address NFT point solutions—yet **we lack an overarching DApp strategy** to dominate as the de facto NFT platform choice.

While Cardano is behind in the NFT market, it is poised to leap frog with Goguen. The foundations will be in place and needing standard scaffolding that is well thought out and open-source to benefit the community of builders.

### Solution

Coordinate an NFT DAO that implements all NFT DApp requirements to build a penultimate composable NFT Framework—**a WAX Killer on Cardano.**

By open-sourcing an NFT DApp development framework that anyone can build a marketplace or NFT business on, we benefit the community by getting to market with many different specialized NFT solutions faster. We save precious community resources building standard frameworks once, instead of redundantly for many projects. This allows teams to focus on their core business logic and UI/UX instead of the complete system.

### Relevance Experience

The 42+ proposing teams cover the range of skills and experience needed to build the best possible solution to dominate the NFT space.

If we can successfully engage the **55 team members** and **774 supporters** of the 42 NFT focused proposals, we will have a great deal of talent and horsepower to build infrastructure that is possibly unmatched in the industry to date. In order to incentivize them and encourage cooperation we will imitate the Catalyst Project and successful DAO structures.

### Rationale

As growth and competition within the Catalyst community increases, we feel it imperative that we as a community consider how to collectively and strategically align our efforts to generate greater synergy: where the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts. We feel this is not only a unique selling point for this proposal within Cardano's NFT space, but also for Cardano as a social, financial and governance infrastructure.

Our rationale for this approach lies in the open and decentralized ethos of Project Catalyst, Cardano and blockchain technology: We can build better together.

Of the 188 fund-seeking proposals for Project Catalyst Fund 3, we identified NFT's as a core area of interest within the Catalyst community, and an area of major growth within the blockchain economy at large. Based on a hashtag search for \#NFT within Catalyst, 42 proposals \(22.34%\) identified an aspect of NFT's as being applicable to their project \(an analysis of these proposals is included further down\). The NFT space as a whole has seen over $150 million in total sales volume since mid-2017 with the majority of growth occurring in 2020, with 115% growth in December alone \[2\].



The reasons this project may be more successful than other solutions is:

1. **Vision** - A macro NFT strategy and DAO will better support the sustainable development of NFT community growth, use, DApp development and tokenization on Cardano than through the limitations of individual competition.
2. **Collectivism** - Each individual NFT project is better served by the collective experience of the community \(as is the case with Project Catalyst itself\), rather than being limited by the experience of one individual or team alone;
3. **Effectiveness** - For NFT proposals that will not be successful in this or future funding rounds, due to a cap on the amount of funds available, NFT proposers will be able to contribute ongoing value rather than be overlooked;

## **Market Opportunity**

### Market Validation

Our goal is to mobilize the Project Catalyst community to stimulate NFT development.

However, we don't think of this community as a market, but as peers. This talent pool of innovators, developers, entrepreneurs and early adopters mark one of the fastest growing DAO communities in the blockchain space. According to a Crypto News Flash article, Cardano's 'decentralized funding platform currently has more registered voters than all of Ethereum's top 100 DAO's combined' \[\#\]. In a recent Catalyst Town Hall \(January 27 2021\) it was identified that there were 5614 members registered with Project Catalyst, a 10% increase from the week before, including 808 members registered as community advisers.

We aim to reinvest in this rapidly growing community, starting with proposers of NFT related projects.

Cardano's Project Catalyst Fund3 saw 42 proposals \(22.34% of total fund-seeking proposals\) interested in a diverse range of NFT use cases. These proposals included 55 team-members in total. As of writing, there were also 774 total kudos given to these proposals, as per IdeaScale's community engagement metric. This represents a broader community of supporters that may or may not be engaging specifically with the NFT elements of each proposal.

This project will seek to approach and invite all of the 55 NFT proposers to contribute to an NFT DAO, as well as making wider invitations to the roughly 774 supporters of those projects, and the broader Catalyst and Cardano communities as a whole. By way of deliverable, this project aims for 30% engagement at the lower bound and 50% engagement at the upper bound.

We will look at engaging these peer groups to build a strategic alignment around NFT development on the blockchain, for the purposes of delivering NFT initiatives to the established Cardano and Crypto communities, and the new crypto and DeFi adopters. This project will be pitched to anyone who wants to build NFTs on Cardano, with the purpose of increasing development and new users to the blockchain.

### Market Size

According to NonFungible.com, the all-time NFT market cap \(since June 2017\), involves 5,227,502 NFT sales with a volume of US$173,885,185.60. The leading NFT sales came through ETH, MANA & WETH with an average price of $33.15. From the year beginning Feb 2020 and ending Feb 2021, the number of daily trades have diminished from 3108 to 1820 \(-58.56%\), however the value of the trades have increased: from a daily volume of US$113,980.23 \(US$36.67 per trade\) to US$1,374,030.61 \(US$757.46 per trade\) \[CITE\]

This represents a **1105.5% increase** in NFT market valuation for the previous year.

### Target Market

Our target market comprises developers, creatives, entrepreneurs, intellectuals, and Cardanians who want to create NFT marketplaces, NFT businesses and attractants to the new capabilities of Cardano that allow anyone to tokenize digital, intellectual, and real world assets.

### Marketing Fundamentals

What is Needed for Success:

* **Market** — robust transactional spaces
* **User** — mass-scale adoption
* **Product** — outcome driven utility

 **Markets** do not occur without Users. **Users** do not arrive unless there is something to use, a **Product** \(or service\). Many of the ideas proposed offer these components and collaborating can amalgamate the best of these.

Example of how we need to think about solutions: Taking a scientific-method, first-principles approach is what brought CryptoKitties to market, the most successful NFT to date. Axiom Zen is a Canadian Venture Studio who's research and processes launched DapperLabs, who brought the CryptoKitties to market. Now they are building FLOW blockchain, a $6MM market cap blockchain. We have Cardano, a $32B market cap blockchain as our tech base. We have a large community of project managers, developers, marketers and researchers who can collectively match any organization in the world. We need to work together.

## **Competitive Analysis**

### Synopsis of Catalyst NFT Proposals

1. NFT use cases primarily fell into three categories: a\) **Digital Asset,** b\) **Intellectual Property Representation,** c\) **Physical World Asset Representation.**
2. Majority of proposals intend to build both minting functionality and their unique marketplace or use case.
3. Total treasury cost to fund proposals can be significantly reduced if majority of proposers focus on building their unique use case / marketplace, while we build out comprehensive modular minting solution.

### Detailed Analysis of Catalyst NFT Proposals

Based on the collation of 42 total Project Catalyst proposals tagged as \#NFT at the date of writing, it was found that 27 proposals had non-fungible tokens as a substantial part of the proposals offering. From a spot analysis of these 27 proposals, four NFT groupings were identified as having direct similarity with other proposals and another five groupings were identified as having an indirect similarity with other proposals on the platform. Of the groupings with direct similarities – where proposals shared the same idea - four proposals were for an NFT art market; three proposals were for NFT gaming apps; three proposals were for NFT's for event ticketing; and two proposals were for NFT trading cards. Of the groupings with indirect similarities - where proposals shared a similar theme but not necessarily the same idea - three proposals suggested NFT's as a business revenue stream \(for decentralized cinema funding, a children's education program and an e-book marketplace\); two proposals were for lottery-based initiatives; two proposals were for general NFT marketplaces \(including one for general creative specializations\); two proposals were for porting NFT protocols from other blockchains; and one proposal generally addressed issues related to game DApp development.





Seventeen existing NFT platforms were identified by the community within the 27 proposals, including Cryptokitties and Superrare \(both referenced two times\), Shimeji, Decentraland, My Crypto Heroes, Somnium Space, Gods Unchained, CryptoVoxel, Blockchain Cuties, CryptoSpaceCommander, Rarible, Known Origin, OpenSea, Mintible, MakersPlace, CryptoArt and CryptoBrewMaster. An online search found 133 other NFT platforms whose offerings generally ranged from collectibles in the form of digital art, characters and game assets. From NonFungible.com's platform listing, 45.8% \(56 of the 125 NFT platforms listed on the website\) had made trades within the last week, while 18.4% \(23 of the 125 platforms listed\) had an all-time sales volume over $1M. The top three, Decentraland, Cryptokitties and Cryptopunks held a combined all-time volume of $88.55M \(almost equal to the all-time volume of the other 122 platforms combined; a point also referenced within @pavpowell's proposal\). Other direct NFT or NFT DAO competitors include: Rarible, Mintable, Flamingo, Aragon, Wax, Ergo Auctions and Mintbase.

### Market Competitors

* Rarible \(NFT DAO\)
* Mintable \(NFT DAO\)
* Flamingo \(NFT DAO\)
* WAX \(NFT Market\)
* ERGO Auction House \(NFT Market\)
* Aragon \(DAO Market\)

**WAX.io Messaging:**

"The safest and most convenient way to create, buy, sell, and trade physical and virtual items — to anyone, anywhere in the world."

**We can build a better WAX alternative on Cardano!**

### Recommendations From Research

From this initial survey of NFT proposals within Project Catalyst, and NFT platforms currently on the market, it is proposed that:

* Consideration be given by the Catalyst community to support a strategic alignment regarding NFT initiatives in a way that will maximize and streamline the collective interests and efforts of the community in this domain;
* As it is forecast that NFT proposals will only proliferate over time, it is proposed that an NFT steering group \(a community within the community\) composed of those with an interest in NFT dev., including recent proposers, may provide a more effective strategy for guiding and fast-tracking Cardano's NFT development. This is in contrast with a scatter-gun or competitive approach, which runs the risk of wasted effort, resources and decreased community morale for unsuccessful proposers;
* It is proposed that the NFT steering group be fluid and open to the community for wider consultation, and act as a resource to NFT proposers or initiatives wishing to remain autonomous;
* It is proposed that the NFT steering group hold a secondary function of monitoring and evaluating its processes for the purposes of knowledge sharing with prospective steering groups that seek to align around other strategic topic areas. It is not intended that such steering groups replace Community Choice campaigns, but that they serve to support the ongoing implementation of past or prospective campaigns.
* It is of note that in the course of this funding round, at least two of the NFT for art market projects did merge their proposals together.



## **Business Model**

_**We intend to create a self sustaining DAO that will incubate NFT innovation and collaboration.**_

* **Marketplace Liquidity Mining:** Earn NFTDAO governance token by minting, selling, and buying NFTs.
* **Transaction Fees:** There will be a small predictable fee involved with the minting of each asset.
* **DeFi offerings:** NFT liquidity pools. Revenue rights granting NFTs.

### DAO Governance

Create a DAO structure to support NFT lifecycles for the Cardano community. Nest the DAO in the Catalyst Project at origin. Obtain community funding for several Fund cycles to build the tech stack.

### Collaboration

Build the frameworks, scaffolding, schemas, patterns and integrations required for a robust NFT offering. Once the tech stack is launched, charge appropriate licensing fee structure justified by service and support to fund the DAO treasury to maintain and enhance the technology and sustain the DAO model.

The DAO may decide to build and operate NFT businesses of their own as well and create an endowment revenue stream to further enhance leadership of Cardano NFTs.

All 35+ proposals do not have a chance to be funded standing alone. However, amalgamating all the NFT ideas and insights stands a great chance of becoming a truly collaborative project that will benefit all the proposers should it create the optimal platform to dominate the NFT space going into the future. It will propel Cardano as the go-to blockchain for NFTs and position us for many point solutions based on NFTs. Together we can become that de facto NFT blockchain choice.

This will take several rounds of progressive development and we intend to further this proposal in future Funds.
