# Catalyst proposal

## Comprehensive NFT Framework Collab

### Proposed by

 Rich Kopcho, Tyler Wales, Finley Mcllwaine and Troy Egan

on 20th January 2021, 6:59 PM

###  **Problem statement**

42 Catalyst proposals address NFT point solutions—yet **we lack an overarching DApp strategy** to dominate as the de facto NFT platform choice.

###  **Describe your solution to the problem**

Coordinate an **NFT DAO that implements all NFT DApp requirements** to build a penultimate composable NFT Framework—**a WAX Killer on Cardano.**

###  **Relevant experience**

The 42 **proposing teams cover the range of skills and experience needed** to build the best possible solution to dominate the NFT space.

##  **A Modular Framework for NFTs on Cardano**

### Vision Statement

NFT-DAO envisions an open-source composable NFT framework for all—instead of multiple point solutions only benefiting some.

NFT DAO envisions a comprehensive NFT strategy and open-source framework that enables all users \(technical and non-technical\) to easily deploy industry specific tokenized asset marketplaces.

We seek an organized community effort to fully define comprehensive requirements for the penultimate NFT platform of any blockchain and build it as a Cardano asset anyone can use to build their specialized marketplaces or NFT solutions upon. We can build better together.

### Problem

42 Catalyst proposals address NFT point solutions—yet **we lack an overarching DApp strategy** to dominate as the de facto NFT platform choice.

While Cardano is behind in the NFT market, it is poised to leap frog with Goguen. The foundations will be in place and needing standard scaffolding that is well thought out and open-source to benefit the community of builders.

### Solution

Coordinate an NFT DAO that implements all NFT DApp requirements to build a penultimate composable NFT Framework—**a WAX Killer on Cardano.**

By open-sourcing an NFT DApp development framework that anyone can build a marketplace or NFT business on, we benefit the community by getting to market with many different specialized NFT solutions faster. We save precious community resources building standard frameworks once, instead of redundantly for many projects. This allows teams to focus on their core business logic and UI/UX instead of the complete system.

### Relevance Experience

The 42+ proposing teams cover the range of skills and experience needed to build the best possible solution to dominate the NFT space.

If we can successfully engage the **55 team members** and **774 supporters** of the 42 NFT focused proposals, we will have a great deal of talent and horsepower to build infrastructure that is possibly unmatched in the industry to date. In order to incentivize them and encourage cooperation we will imitate the Catalyst Project and successful DAO structures.

### Rationale

As growth and competition within the Catalyst community increases, we feel it imperative that we as a community consider how to collectively and strategically align our efforts to generate greater synergy: where the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts. We feel this is not only a unique selling point for this proposal within Cardano's NFT space, but also for Cardano as a social, financial and governance infrastructure.

Our rationale for this approach lies in the open and decentralized ethos of Project Catalyst, Cardano and blockchain technology: We can build better together.

Of the 188 fund-seeking proposals for Project Catalyst Fund 3, we identified NFT's as a core area of interest within the Catalyst community, and an area of major growth within the blockchain economy at large. Based on a hashtag search for \#NFT within Catalyst, 42 proposals \(22.34%\) identified an aspect of NFT's as being applicable to their project \(an analysis of these proposals is included further down\). The NFT space as a whole has seen over $150 million in total sales volume since mid-2017 with the majority of growth occurring in 2020, with 115% growth in December alone \[2\].



The reasons this project may be more successful than other solutions is:

1. **Vision** - A macro NFT strategy and DAO will better support the sustainable development of NFT community growth, use, DApp development and tokenization on Cardano than through the limitations of individual competition.
2. **Collectivism** - Each individual NFT project is better served by the collective experience of the community \(as is the case with Project Catalyst itself\), rather than being limited by the experience of one individual or team alone;
3. **Effectiveness** - For NFT proposals that will not be successful in this or future funding rounds, due to a cap on the amount of funds available, NFT proposers will be able to contribute ongoing value rather than be overlooked;

## **Market Opportunity**

### Market Validation

Our goal is to mobilize the Project Catalyst community to stimulate NFT development.

However, we don't think of this community as a market, but as peers. This talent pool of innovators, developers, entrepreneurs and early adopters mark one of the fastest growing DAO communities in the blockchain space. According to a Crypto News Flash article, Cardano's 'decentralized funding platform currently has more registered voters than all of Ethereum's top 100 DAO's combined' \[\#\]. In a recent Catalyst Town Hall \(January 27 2021\) it was identified that there were 5614 members registered with Project Catalyst, a 10% increase from the week before, including 808 members registered as community advisers.

We aim to reinvest in this rapidly growing community, starting with proposers of NFT related projects.

Cardano's Project Catalyst Fund3 saw 42 proposals \(22.34% of total fund-seeking proposals\) interested in a diverse range of NFT use cases. These proposals included 55 team-members in total. As of writing, there were also 774 total kudos given to these proposals, as per IdeaScale's community engagement metric. This represents a broader community of supporters that may or may not be engaging specifically with the NFT elements of each proposal.

This project will seek to approach and invite all of the 55 NFT proposers to contribute to an NFT DAO, as well as making wider invitations to the roughly 774 supporters of those projects, and the broader Catalyst and Cardano communities as a whole. By way of deliverable, this project aims for 30% engagement at the lower bound and 50% engagement at the upper bound.

We will look at engaging these peer groups to build a strategic alignment around NFT development on the blockchain, for the purposes of delivering NFT initiatives to the established Cardano and Crypto communities, and the new crypto and DeFi adopters. This project will be pitched to anyone who wants to build NFTs on Cardano, with the purpose of increasing development and new users to the blockchain.

### Market Size

According to NonFungible.com, the all-time NFT market cap \(since June 2017\), involves 5,227,502 NFT sales with a volume of US$173,885,185.60. The leading NFT sales came through ETH, MANA & WETH with an average price of $33.15. From the year beginning Feb 2020 and ending Feb 2021, the number of daily trades have diminished from 3108 to 1820 \(-58.56%\), however the value of the trades have increased: from a daily volume of US$113,980.23 \(US$36.67 per trade\) to US$1,374,030.61 \(US$757.46 per trade\) \[CITE\]

This represents a **1105.5% increase** in NFT market valuation for the previous year.

### Target Market

Our target market comprises developers, creatives, entrepreneurs, intellectuals, and Cardanians who want to create NFT marketplaces, NFT businesses and attractants to the new capabilities of Cardano that allow anyone to tokenize digital, intellectual, and real world assets.

### Marketing Fundamentals

What is Needed for Success:

* **Market** — robust transactional spaces
* **User** — mass-scale adoption
* **Product** — outcome driven utility

 **Markets** do not occur without Users. **Users** do not arrive unless there is something to use, a **Product** \(or service\). Many of the ideas proposed offer these components and collaborating can amalgamate the best of these.

Example of how we need to think about solutions: Taking a scientific-method, first-principles approach is what brought CryptoKitties to market, the most successful NFT to date. Axiom Zen is a Canadian Venture Studio who's research and processes launched DapperLabs, who brought the CryptoKitties to market. Now they are building FLOW blockchain, a $6MM market cap blockchain. We have Cardano, a $32B market cap blockchain as our tech base. We have a large community of project managers, developers, marketers and researchers who can collectively match any organization in the world. We need to work together.

## **Competitive Analysis**

### Synopsis of Catalyst NFT Proposals

1. NFT use cases primarily fell into three categories: a\) **Digital Asset,** b\) **Intellectual Property Representation,** c\) **Physical World Asset Representation.**
2. Majority of proposals intend to build both minting functionality and their unique marketplace or use case.
3. Total treasury cost to fund proposals can be significantly reduced if majority of proposers focus on building their unique use case / marketplace, while we build out comprehensive modular minting solution.
