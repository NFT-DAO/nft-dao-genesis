# How ?

First task is be very clear what our goal is—build the BOXCAR.

A DAO is simply a means of organizing the work \(the O in DAO\). It’s an organizational model. It provides guidance for who does what, when, how and why through well-established communications and a set of rules or functions. Thus, our very first task was defining the work to be done and assigning owners.

There is more to it, like governance, participation, fair contribution reward dispersal and other items that will be worked out as we move forward. The participation is interesting in a DAO because the A is for autonomous. It is autonomous yet cooperative behavior that defines participants. The D is for Decentralized, or no centralized system of control. We will take the journey together and the DAO will emerge from the work we do. We will build the canon or rules of engagement as we accomplish our core goal of creating the BOXCAR.

Much like IOHK is slowly releasing Cardano so the community can take it over, we will model similar behavior with NFT DAO. Also, Catalyst itself is modeling similar behavior as a means to engage the community in self-governance. It will not succeed if we simply ‘will’ it into existence without guidance, nurturing, educating participants and maturing it to be the community’s responsibility. We have a long-term view of the viability this asset can become for the Cardano community and are wholly committed to seeing it to fruition.

Hopefully this gives you a sense what we aim to accomplish.

1. Build the BOXCAR, a composable framework for NFT business models
2. Allow NFT DAO to emerge for our work and guidance
