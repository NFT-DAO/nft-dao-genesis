Producing WyoHackathon the past three years has brought me into close relationships with the Cardano, IOHK and Emurgo community and teams. From my history of open-sourcing projects, I noticed a level of professionalism behind the Cardano project that I felt compelled to support more fully at a personal level.

We submitted WyoHackathon’s IOHK challenges Oct. 2020 through the Catalyst program. Since I was producing the hackathon I didn’t propose anything until Fund 3. I wanted to support the model by contributing proposals and learning how the processes and community are operating. I added several items in the F3 Ideas stage and three final proposals. Since this proposal under the dApp Creation category resonates with other NFT proposers and is drawing contributors in to help, I’d like to provide a deeper understanding of what we envision.
