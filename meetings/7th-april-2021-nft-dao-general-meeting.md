### How this will inform our reporting

> Maybe we don't need our reports then ? - [19.16](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=1156) - **Dan Verowski**, **Stephen Rowan**
>
> Hoping that this will inform our reporting.
>
> This is just the beginning, so we are still having teething problems with how people not used to GitHub use it and how to allocate work. But hopefully it’s the beginning of quantifying what we are doing so when it comes to tokenization we have data available.

## Discussion

### Idea of Triaging Consensus Levels arose out of comments on the NFT-DAO Charter Issue - [20.03](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=1203) - **Troy Egan**

> HOLONs need to consider, for the AGILE/innovative stage of a project, what information do we need public/community consensus on and what tasks/actions to we need just HOLON consensus on. In an emergent process some of our tasks/actions can be slowed down by the process of community input we are committed to. Sometimes a lot of the community are not engaged or are just new.
>
> Started doing flowchart around :
>
> * onboarding process - how people/members come on Discord and engage
> * consensus - amongst new people/members
> * How are we triaging levels of engagement
>
> These factors also tie into our tokenization model.
>
> Do we need a communications HOLON that is keeping everyone on the same page? A HOLON that could triage what should be allocated to public/community consensus or what should be private. Also look at how contribution tokens are attached to a triaging model.
>
> Also look at what should be distributed/heterarchical and what should be hierarchical.

### Charles Hoskinson's Roadmap  - [24.23](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=1463) - **Stephen Rowan**

> We are currently a Plutocratic model and need to move to a Hybrid model.
>
> Source : "Also going to launch a research agenda to move from a Plutocratic model \(ADA's current status\) to a Hybrid model \(ADA plus Proof of Merit\). Proof of Merit is a very ill-defined concept - consequentially deliverable is closer to 2025 than 2021." \([Source](https://stephen-rowan.gitbook.io/nft-dao/governance/dao-models#some-musings-about-the-roadmap)\)

### Did Charles refer to Cardano and did he say "Autocracy" - [24.23](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=1554) - **Rich Kopcho**

> **Correction** : Stephen said "Autocracy" when Charles actually said "Plutocratic model" - \(apologies\). 
> 
> *Autocracy* = rule by one dictator / *Plutocracy* - rule by by people of great wealth or income.
>
> He was speaking tongue-in-cheek - **Stephen Rowan**
>
> He was speaking tongue-in-cheek, in that the Cardano projects have all started off from a point of centralised authority to get things done. But the aim of Cardano,  unlike other centralised authorities, is self-destructive, in that it aims to dissolve itself.

### Communication Discussion - [27.22](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=1642) - **Rich Kopcho**, **Troy Egan**

> Did you mean communication to the outside world or inside the HOLON? -  **Rich Kopcho**

> I meant a Communication HOLON directed internally - **Troy Egan**
