Reference : README message in "Governance-HOLON Vault" Private repository

> Scope
>
> This repository should only contain :
>
> * Draft work to be migrated to the LIVE Governance-HOLON repository
> * Commercially or strategically sensitive information.

* **White Paper** - Unsure about time frame, priority, deadline. As it is a more in-depth document. - **Troy Egan**

  > Anyone wishing to contribute should contact Gov-HOLON.

> Draft White paper currently located in samepage. Requires input from Development at some point.

### GitHub Overview  - [17,02](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=1022) - **Stephen Rowan**

> Beginning the process of open sourcing as per Fund 3 proposal commitments.
>
> We currently have 4 Gov-HOLON projects \([Gov-HOLON Project List](https://github.com/NFT-DAO/Governance-HOLON/projects)\) on the public [Governance-HOLON](https://github.com/NFT-DAO/Governance-HOLON) repository.
>
> Aiming to transfer Gov-HOLON deliverables to GitHub Project Boards, then break these down further into tasks \(GitHub Issues\) and then allocate Issues to HOLON members.
>
> This week Gov-HOLON had its first community call-out on Discord as an experiment to see how GitHub Issues might work. Starting with the Issue [Draft NFT-DAO Charter \#29](https://github.com/NFT-DAO/Governance-HOLON/issues/29).
>
> Currently building project dashboards on the [Governance-HOLON](https://github.com/NFT-DAO/Governance-HOLON) landing page for people not familiar with GitHub.

>
> Taking each section of the Business Plan and :

* working out who should be the best person \(HOLON members\) delegated that section
* how it breaks down into scope \(what the section covers\)
* how it allocates to tasks \(or issues\)
* and how it can be transferred to open-source

#### How this will inform our reporting

> Maybe we don't need our reports then ? - [19.16](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=1156) - **Dan Verowski**, **Stephen Rowan**
>
> Hoping that this will inform our reporting.
>
> This is just the beginning, so we are still having teething problems with how people not used to GitHub use it and how to allocate work. But hopefully it’s the beginning of quantifying what we are doing so when it comes to tokenization we have data available.

## Discussion

### Idea of Triaging Consensus Levels arose out of comments on the NFT-DAO Charter Issue - [20.03](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=1203) - **Troy Egan**

> HOLONs need to consider, for the AGILE/innovative stage of a project, what information do we need public/community consensus on and what tasks/actions to we need just HOLON consensus on. In an emergent process some of our tasks/actions can be slowed down by the process of community input we are committed to. Sometimes a lot of the community are not engaged or are just new.
>
> Started doing flowchart around :
>
> * on-boarding process - how people/members come on Discord and engage
> * consensus - amongst new people/members
> * How are we triaging levels of engagement
>
> These factors also tie into our tokenization model.
>
> Do we need a communications HOLON that is keeping everyone on the same page? A HOLON that could triage what should be allocated to public/community consensus or what should be private. Also look at how contribution tokens are attached to a triaging model.
>
> Also look at what should be distributed/heterarchical and what should be hierarchical.

### Charles Hoskinson's Roadmap  - [24.23](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=1463) - **Stephen Rowan**

> We are currently a Plutocratic model and need to move to a Hybrid model.
>
> Source : "Also going to launch a research agenda to move from a Plutocratic model \(ADA's current status\) to a Hybrid model \(ADA plus Proof of Merit\). Proof of Merit is a very ill-defined concept - consequentially deliverable is closer to 2025 than 2021." \([Source](https://stephen-rowan.gitbook.io/nft-dao/governance/dao-models#some-musings-about-the-roadmap)\)

### Did Charles refer to Cardano and did he say "Autocracy" - [24.23](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=1554) - **Rich Kopcho**

> **Correction** : Stephen said "Autocracy" when Charles actually said "Plutocratic model" - \(apologies\).
>
> _Autocracy_ = rule by one dictator / _Plutocracy_ - rule by by people of great wealth or income.
>
> He was speaking tongue-in-cheek - **Stephen Rowan**
>
> He was speaking tongue-in-cheek, in that the Cardano projects have all started off from a point of centralized authority to get things done. But the aim of Cardano, unlike other centralized authorities, is self-destructive, in that it aims to dissolve itself.

## Communication Discussion - [27.22](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=1642) - **Rich Kopcho**, **Troy Egan**, **Stephen Rowan**, **Dan Verowski**

> Did you mean communication to the outside world or inside the HOLON? - **Rich Kopcho**
>
> I meant a Communication HOLON directed internally - **Troy Egan**
>
> The life blood of a Holonic Organization is communication - **Rich Kopcho**
>
> It seems to me that the person who has stepped up to take up that burden is Stephen. He is our resource that is gathering up that stuff and putting it in a way that people can digest it.
>
> A self-sufficient system - [28.40](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=1720) - **Stephen Rowan**
>
> My objective is to create a self-sufficient system so that the DAO is open-source and does not depend on a single person as indispensable. But we will need to recruit more people experienced in open source project-planning.
>
> In the Holonic Organization there isn't a Communication HOLON because there is communication between HOLONs - [30:07](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=1807) - **Rich Kopcho**
>
> Part of the Canon is the communication link. What gets communicated from what HOLON to the next HOLON and under what circumstances. In the emergence of that HOLON they identify "who needs what from them" in the sense of on-going communication. That is how you build that communication infrastructure. We are emerging - so we are going through the growing pains of figuring that out.
>
> How do you know beforehand what information needs to be distributed ? - [31.01](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=1861) - **Dan Verowski**
>
> How can you have a regulation for it beforehand ?
>
> The key is "beforehand" - [31.20](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=1880) - **Rich Kopcho**
>
> If you're trying to plan all this stuff beforehand you'll never get it done. It is emergent behavior. As you are emerging and discovering what your information requirements are - you are discovering your Canon. It is a living document.
>
> An organic, emergent process is already happening - [32.27](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=1947) - **Stephen Rowan**
>
> For example people are including each other in HOLON channels in order to achieve transparency.
>
> In emergent behavior, you need something - you make the connection - **Rich Kopcho**
>
> Does'nt an infrastructure for distributed information already exist ? - [33.11](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=1991) - **Dan Verowski**
>
> Not just about access to information - [33.22](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=2002) - **Stephen Rowan**
>
> Not just about access to information, its also about awareness about how each HOLON is operating and breaking down information silos. And also focusing on immediate objectives across different HOLONs.

> We are emerging in our own processes as HOLONs - [34.06](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=2046) - **Troy Egan**
>
> Shared responsibility within each HOLON to represent the HOLON. Propose that each of our HOLONs has delegates that HOLON leads are communicating to.

## There is no highest level of the organisation - [35.58](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=2158) -  **Rich Kopcho**

> Some of you guys have a lot more power or pull than other people - [36.20](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=2180) - **Philip Roberts**

## Auction MVP \(Minimum Viable Product\) Discussion - [37.25](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=2245) - **Tyler Wales**, **Rich Kopcho**, **New Mindflow**

> We have 22 Artists signed up ? - **Rich Kopcho**
>
> Now we have 23 Artists. - **New Mindflow**
>
> We thought of giving Artists two days to respond to email circular ? - **Tyler Wales**
>
> Email roundup - [37.56](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=2276) - **New Mindflow**
>
> Andy suggested sending out an email to all the artists working on Cardano related artworks.
>
> New Mindflow requested a two-day window to maximize the onboarding of more artists given the 6-week time-frame. And allow them time to create new pieces. We can still leave the form up and contact artists again after this initial message.

## Development MVP \(Minimum Viable Product\) - [38.57](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=2337) - **Rich Kopcho**

> In conversation with mutual-knowledge - they are working on a Glow auction facility.

## Fund 5 Proposals - [40.16](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=2416) - **Rich Kopcho**

> We have several Fund 5 Proposals in preparation:

### An API for the overall marketplace \(with mutual-knowledge?\)

### Smart contracts that will enforce residual distribution \(royalties\)

> splitting distribution of royalties to multiple parties not a trivial process.

### Metadata continuity

> compatibility layer between ETH \(Ethereum\) and ADA token metadata
>
> Where to store standard metadata - off-chain / on-chain options

### Wallet support - [42.16](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=2536) - **Rich Kopcho**

> Payment solutions
>
> Insight submitted on Stripe Like Wallet Connector - "Let's make wallets on Cardano as simple as one line of code to connect and use in your Dapp."

> mutual-knowledge are working on similar solutions.
>
> In three months \(given lead times for funding\) these options could be possible.

### "Beam me up Scotty" - [43.48](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=2628) - **Rich Kopcho**

> We need a name for "Beam me up Scotty" - teleporting NFTs between different blockchains. Usability and interorperability across blockchains. How do we get there from here. How to do you lock/unlock tokens "transported" between different chains ?

Reference :

{% embed url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam\_me\_up,\_Scotty" caption="" %}

> Working with mutual-knowledge on such cross-chain solutions takes us into the realm of a bigger eco-system play for NFT-DAO.

### Plutus Smart Contract functionality in July 2021 - [46.09](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=2769) - **Rich Kopcho**

> Shortly after Plutus is Live mutual-knowledge will have Smart Contracts ready for us. - **Rich Kopcho**
>
> In preparation, we can start writing our contracts well ahead of time by using mutual-knowledge's Glow. People in our Development HOLON are getting into the Plutus Pioneer Program to provide a Haskell focus as well. The long-term vision for us is to be as interoperable as possible - to provide a generic, cross platform NFT-DAO that is not specific to Cardano. One of the prime reasons to reach out to other chains is recruitment of legacy blockchain talent. Bring them in. - **Rich Kopcho**
>
> To the extent that it remains the most efficient way and the most green way Cardano's blockchain has the edge - **Rich Kopcho**
>
> Cardano \(ADA\) core of fungibility - [48.03](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=2883) - **Stephen Rowan**
>
> I suppose that ADA is the core of fungibility and Governance - but NFT-DAO does not need to be completely dependent on one chain commercially. For example blockchains are being specifically built for the archiving space which could interface through any number of chains depending on Governance and fungibility preferences.

### Discussion - [50.36](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=3036) - **Rich Kopcho**, **Tyler Wales**, **Stephen Rowan**, **Dan Verowski**

> I thought we decided to assume we are using IPFS in the Minimum Viable Product - **Rich Kopcho**

> We never made a concrete decision on it. But IPFS seemed to be what most other NFTs are using - **Tyler Wales**

> We may have to do a comparison of different solutions and providers - **Stephen Rowan**

> IPFS and Arweave together is like a decentralised pinning service- **Dan Verowski**

> We should put together a competitive research document for storage solutions. - **Tyler Wales**

> We can do the research anyway, but the Development Team need to select an IPFS solution for the MVP - **Dan Verowski**

> For the MVP we want to deliver something quickly and that will have a long shelf life for our particular use-case. But there are going to be all sorts of NFT use-cases created with NFT-DAO. What solution we choose will be valuable information to the wider community and inform future NFT projects - **Tyler Wales**

> I will liaise with Sev and Hud because they may already have some information about that in the Business model analysis. If not then we will take a field in on storage solutions - [54.02](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=3242) - **Troy Egan**


### Storage of multiple NFTs - [55.15](https://youtu.be/wnVupMQtjp4?t=3315) - **New Mindflow**

> If we go down the route of minting several copies of the NFT. Do we need to store each of them individually or can multiple editions point to a single file ?

> It would be redundant to have multiple copies of the file image, given that an edition is only produced by code in the NFT script - **Dan Verowski**
